# **CCNA-Basic-Cisco-Configuration**
### In this section I'm gonna configure Basic Cisco configuration using a Cisco router (In this practical I'm using Cisco 1841 Routers)

#### As the first step open the packet tracer and drag  2x Cisco 1841 routers to the screen and label them with your preference (For now I'm labeling with **COLOMBO** and **KANDY**)
