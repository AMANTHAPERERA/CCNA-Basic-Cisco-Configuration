# **CCNA-Basic-Cisco-Configuration**
<br>

## In this task , I'm configuring basic Cisco configuration using  Cisco routers. (In this practical I'm using Cisco 1841 Routers)

### As the first step open the packet tracer and drag  2x Cisco 1841 routers to the screen and label them with your preference  (For now I'm labeling with **COLOMBO** and **KANDY**)

<br>

## Now I'm gonna split this task into below sections<br>

1. **Initial configuration { host name , MOTD banner (optional) }**
2. **Adjusting date and time**
3. **Assigning IP addresses with a description**
4. **Configuring  Passwords / Breaking Passwords / Recovering Passwords**

<br>

1. # INITIAL CONFIGURATION
 <br>

 ### Guess what?  Imagine we have a brand new / reset router to configure , then we have to do some essential configuration for over convenience .
 ### It's more important to configure host name for our convenience. Imagine we have to work with more than 2 routers , We are confusing ourselves when we  need to identify them each.
 ### As I mentioned we have already labeled our routers as “COLOMBO” and  “KANDY” respectively.
